Final Project for CS348 at Purdue

To Run The Server:
* First, start the server by opening a terminal and cd into the backend directory
* Run the command `npm start dev`
* The server should now be running (If your IP address isn't compatible with the MONGODB database, that is an issue)

To Run the Webpage:
* Start another terminal
* cd into the frontend directory
* run `npm start`
